Halo!

My name is Muhammad Zaky Zulfiqor.

I just a simple person who like photography, videography, code, and cyber security enthusiast.

I like listening to J-Pop, J-Rock, Rock, Deathcore, Electronicore, Metalcore, and other some-underground music and use my choice of music for positive self-regulatory purposes.

Sometimes, I write songs/make music covers just for fun or when I want to express something. You can check my YouTube or Spotify page at:

* {{< url-link "https://zaky.my.id/spotify/" "https://zaky.my.id/spotify/" "target">}}

And I use LinkedIn {{< url-link "[https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammadzakyzulfiqor/]" "https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammadzakyzulfiqor/" "target">}} for keeping a basic online resume. I don't link to everyone who asks, I try to make sure I have met in person, or know of you through friends before I accept an invite.
